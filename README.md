#Project 3 - <i>Farmers Market Finder</i>

## Overview

####Live Site: [Heroku](https://farmers-marker-finder.herokuapp.com)

A simple, beautiful website dedicated to users who are passionate about logging their expriences in an increasingly popular activity: shopping at farmers markets.

The website works by a user attending his/her favorite market in person and then if they like their experience, they can create and add a market "pin" to the included Google Map for future reference.

This website uses user location verification and geolocation technologies to provide the user with his/her location in a quick and effictive manner, so the user doesn't have to search for his/her location everytime they logon.

## Unsolved Problems/Major Hurdles

#### Unsolved Problems

* "Edit" and "Delete" Button Functionality.
* "Market Name" and "Address" need exact matches, instead of partial matches.

#### Major Hurdles

* Was able to get Query Parameters to function.
* Was able to get "Distance" portion of query to function as intended.
* Was able to get DB to work properly in persisting our data.
* Was able to establish good Git/GitHub practices for "group dynamics."

## Future Development

* Get Buttons In Info Windows attached to each Pin fully functioning.
* User Authentication and Authorization.
* Add a "Reviews" feature to each market so users can share experiences with one another.
